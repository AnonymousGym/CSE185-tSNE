Version 0.0.1

DRV stands for Dimensional Reduction and Visualization, just like its name, this tool aims to work for the biological datasets that usually have multiple variables with relatively high dimension that people cannot describe any rational tendency by just visualize by eye or use traditional data analysis methods. DRV reduce datasets' dimension to the most visualizable state and presents only the top significant features in order to describe the trends of the datasets. In order to maintain the data quality, our tool also tries to minimize the loss of relevant information, so the efficiency and accuracy is guaranteed. The final result would be a 2-dimensional graph that illustrate the relationship between the variables.
